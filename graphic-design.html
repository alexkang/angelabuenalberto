<h2>Zeehaus</h2>
Zeehaus is an online real estate startup company based in San Francisco. Their “mission is to help solve the housing crisis, lower transaction costs and simplify real estate investing”. As the graphic designer for Zeehaus, I’m tasked with creating graphics, icons and infographics to match the style of their <a href="https://zeehaus.com" target="_blank">website</a>. I work with the web developer to keep the iconography consisted with the look and feel of the website.
<h3>Process</h3>

The style they wanted me to incorporate in the graphics are modern and simple. So to show that, I did a dual color scheme to make the icons look minimal yet appealing by having that contrast. The icons also have rounded corners to make it have a modern feel.

For a section in the front page of the website, I was asked to create lined icons to go along with the following information. To keep the design consistent with the other main icons and graphics, I kept the rounded corners. I went with one color instead of two, to keep the simplicity and to differentiate it from the others.

The infographic was made to accompany the section “Our Mission” in the front page to help the viewer understand how the Zeehaus process works through visuals. I made it a roadmap so anyone can easily follow the process along and have a better understanding of what is to be expected after they sign up. The style of the infographic was to be consistent with the main icons on the website, but with more added details. The text was to follow the look of the graphics as well.
<h3>Final</h3>

The website is still undergoing changes since it hasn’t officially launched yet, so more graphics are still to be added.
<h2>Seams When Pigs Fly</h2>
This is a concept design I did for a local business called Seams When Pigs Fly. They make custom design shirts, embroidery, and letterman jackets. I decided to redeisgn their logo to look more whimsical by using a crayon-like texture for the outlines, and pastel colors to match. I also designed business cards and a mock webpage to showcase how the final product would've looked like.

<h2>Yoon Vintage</h2>
Yoon Vintage is an independent online vintage store based in Philadelphia by Korean American, Casey Leo Yoon. I made a concept designs for her logo, label, and tote bags. I was inspired by her and the way she presents herself on Instagram. I wanted to incorporate tattoo inspired as well as a symbol of Korea.
