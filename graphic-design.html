  <h1>Seams When Pigs Fly</h1>
  This is a concept design I did for a local business called Seams When Pigs Fly. They make custom design shirts, embroidery, and letterman jackets. I decided to redeisgn their logo to look more whimsical by using a crayon-like texture for the outlines, and pastel colors to match. I also designed business cards and a mock webpage to showcase how the final product would've looked like.

  <h1>Yoon Vintage</h1>
  Yoon Vintage is an independent online vintage store based in Philadelphia by Korean American, Casey Leo Yoon. I made a concept designs for her logo, label, and tote bags. I was inspired by her and the way she presents herself on Instagram. I wanted to incorporate tattoo inspired as well as a symbol of Korea.
