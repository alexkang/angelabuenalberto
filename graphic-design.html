<h2>Zeehaus</h2>
<div id="zeehaus-logo-artifacts"></div>
Zeehaus is an online real estate startup company based in San Francisco. Their mission is to "help solve the housing crisis, lower transaction costs and simplify real estate investing."
<p>
As the graphic designer for Zeehaus I’m tasked with creating graphics, icons and infographics to match the style of their <a href="https://zeehaus.com" target="_blank">website</a>. I work with the web developer to keep the iconography consistent with the branding.
<h3>Iconography</h3>
<div id="zeehaus-iconography-artifacts"></div>
The style they wanted me to incorporate in the graphics are modern and simple to go along with their websites theme. So to show that, I did a dual color scheme for the main icons and for another set I went with lines only. This was to make the icons look minimal yet appealing by having contrast. The icons also have rounded corners to have a modern feel.

An infographic I made for the website can be found under the "Make a difference" section of their home page. The infographic was made to accompany the section “Our Mission” in order to help the viewer understand how the Zeehaus process works through visuals.
<h3>Website</h3>

The website is still undergoing changes since it hasn’t officially launched yet, so more graphics are still to be added. 
<h2>Seams When Pigs Fly</h2>
This is a concept design I did for a local business called Seams When Pigs Fly. They make custom design shirts, embroidery, and letterman jackets. I decided to redeisgn their logo to look more whimsical by using a crayon-like texture for the outlines, and pastel colors to match. I also designed business cards and a mock webpage to showcase how the final product would've looked like.

<h2>Yoon Vintage</h2>
Yoon Vintage is an independent online vintage store based in Philadelphia by Korean American, Casey Leo Yoon. I made a concept designs for her logo, label, and tote bags. I was inspired by her and the way she presents herself on Instagram. I wanted to incorporate tattoo inspired as well as a symbol of Korea.
