    Howdy, I’m Angela!
    <p>
    I’m an artist born and raised (and still residing) in the Bay Area. I graduated from San Francisco State University in 2018 with a B.A. in studio art and a minor in animation. 
    <p>
    I’ve always been interested in graphic design, but didn’t decide to pursue it until after I graduated college. I love creating playful experiences, and through that I aim to make things more approachable through design. I’m currently studying and creating projects independently, while doing part time graphic design work for a startup. 
    <p>
    When I’m not drawing or designing I like to watch Unsolved Mysteries, play Stardew Valley, or listen to (best boy) KK slider! ♡
