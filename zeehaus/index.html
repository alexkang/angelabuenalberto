<h1>Zeehaus</h1>
<div id="logo"></div>
Zeehaus is an online real estate startup company based in San Francisco. Their mission is to "help solve the housing crisis, lower transaction costs and simplify real estate investing."
<p>
As the graphic designer for Zeehaus I’m tasked with creating graphics, icons and infographics to match the style of their <a href="https://zeehaus.com" target="_blank">website</a>. I work with the web developer to keep the iconography consistent with the branding.
<h2>Iconography</h2>
<div id="iconography"></div>
The style they wanted me to incorporate in the graphics are modern and simple to go along with their websites theme. So to show that, I did a dual color scheme for the main icons and for another set I went with lines only. This was to make the icons look minimal yet appealing by having contrast. The icons also have rounded corners to have a modern feel.

An infographic I made for the website can be found under the "Make a difference" section of their home page. The infographic was made to accompany the section “Our Mission” in order to help the viewer understand how the Zeehaus process works through visuals.
<h2>Website</h2>
<div id="website"></div>
The website is still undergoing changes since it hasn’t officially launched yet, so more graphics are still to be added.
