<h1>Seams When Pigs Fly</h1>
This is a concept design I did for a local business called Seams When Pigs Fly. They make custom design shirts, embroidery, and letterman jackets. I decided to redeisgn their logo to look more whimsical by using a crayon-like texture for the outlines, and pastel colors to match. I also designed business cards and a mock webpage to showcase how the final product would've looked like.
